Coding Sable Diffusion in pytorch
This project can be viewed as a journey to enter the field.

**Topic discussed**
- Latent Diffusion Models from scratch in Pytorch. No other libs used except for tokenizer.
- Maths of diffusion models as defined in the DDPM paper.
- Classifier-Free Guidance
- Text to Image
- Image to Image
- Inpainting
  
**Future works**
- Score-based models
- ODE and SDE theoretical framework for diffusion models(which is harder, so I will talk about it later)
- Eulaer,Runge-Kutta and derived samplers

**Prerequisites for learning this framwork**
- Basic of statisitcs
- Basic of deeplearning and pytorch
- How the attention mechanism works
- How convolution layers work
  
Detailed framework can be found at framework.ipynb(which will be written in Chinese)
