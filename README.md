基于pytorch手搓扩散模型，可以作为新手学习入门项目。
Coding Sable Diffusion in pytorch

**Topic discussed**
- Latent Diffusion Models from scratch in Pytorch. No other libs used except for tokenizer.
- Maths of diffusion models as defined in the DDPM paper.
- Classifier-Free Guidance
- Text to Image
- Image to Image
- Inpainting
  
**Future works**
- Score-based models
- ODE and SDE theoretical framework for diffusion models
- Eulaer,Runge-Kutta and derived samplers

**Prereuisites for learning this framwork**
- Basic of statisitcs
- Basic of deeplearning and pytorch
- How the attention mechanism works
- How convolution layers work
